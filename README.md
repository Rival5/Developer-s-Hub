# Developer-s-Hub

Project Description:

Internet is a huge resource of Data and source and There are lots of developers who are searching for free libraries and source code for different programming languages but it is difficult and time consuming to search on various sites.

So here is the solution.

Developer's Hub is an Android App which provides a free libraries and source code for any programming languages.
It has a well organized, categorized and highly customisable Dashboard with rich User interface. User can search for any library or source code for different programming languages. User can also upload their own source code by registering into the App. It also enables user to download free libraries and source code as well as let user share, rate and comment. This Application is very useful for Students as well as Developers. 

This App was developed for My Final Year University Project.
